##  README

The project aims to compile solutions for **Flex Your Brain** exercises appearing at the end of each chapter in the book [UNIX Concepts and Applications - Fourth Edition][book], authored by **Sumitabha Das**.

This book is recommended in many Computer Science, Computer Applications and Information Technology courses across universities in India. It is also quite popular among students learning UNIX and GNU/Linux.

The questions in the exercises are slightly involved, and the solutions for the same are not made available. The project aims at creating a study aid for students of the book.

All the exercise questions are solved and tested on computers running:

-   [macOS Monterey][macOS] version 12.4 (21F79), a POSIX-compliant UNIX operating system developed to run on Apple Mac computers.

-   [Ubuntu Desktop Linux][Ubuntu] version 22.04 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish), a Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution.

Both the computers are running version 5.1.16(1)-release of [GNU Bash][Bash] as the choice of shell.

Every effort has been made to ensure the correctness and completeness of solutions while keeping the differences between the two platforms in mind. However, it is advisable to refer to the available documentation for the commands (using `man` pages, `info` pages or online help).

### Conventions

The following convensions are used:

-   Key terms are shown in **Bold**

-   Command line, expressions and symbols are wrapped in `backticks`

-   File and path names are _italicised_
