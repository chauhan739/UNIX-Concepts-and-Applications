The project aims to compile solutions for **Flex Your Brain** exercises appearing at the end of each chapter in the book [UNIX Concepts and Applications - Fourth Edition][book], authored by **Sumitabha Das**.

This book is a recommended reading in many Computer Science, Computer Applications and Information Technology courses across universities in India. It is also quite popular among students learning UNIX and GNU/Linux.

The questions in the exercise are slightly involved, and the solutions for the same are not made available. The project aims at creating a study aid for the students.

All the exercise questions are solved and tested on computers running:

-   [macOS Ventura][macOS] version 13.0, a POSIX compliant UNIX operating system developed to run on Apple Mac computers.

-   [Ubuntu Desktop Linux][ubuntu] version Ubuntu 22.10 Kinetic Kudu, a Debian based GNU/Linux distribution.

Both the computers are running version 5.2 of [GNU Bash][bash] as the choice of shell.

All efforts have been made to ensure correctness and completeness of solutions while keeping the differences between the two platforms in mind. However, it is advised to refer to available documentation for the commands (using `man` pages, `info` pages or online help).

### Notes

-   Starting with macOS Big Sur 11.0 which was released in November 2020, macOS is compiled for both Intel chips (x86_64 architecture) and Apple Silicon chips (ARM architecture). The current version of Bash is natively compiled for both Intel x86_64 architecture as well as Apple Silicon ARM architecture. All the exercises are tested on both the builds of Bash on Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

-   Linux is not a replacement for UNIX. Ubuntu Linux has been used as the choice of Linux distribution due to its popularity and wide adoption.
